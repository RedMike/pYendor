                            own algorithm didn't work, then fixing it meant it
                            was way too slow to actually use. will revisit

                        The next release will be done in an unordered fashion,
                because obviously, documenting something, then cleaning it up
                is inefficient, and I'm not sure where I need to clean up and 
                where to improve for all of it.
